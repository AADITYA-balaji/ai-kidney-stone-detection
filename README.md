# AI-Powered Early Kidney Stone Awareness System (MVP)

## Overview
This project is a **web-based Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** designed to provide **early awareness** of potential kidney stone risk by analyzing uploaded kidney images.

Kidney stones are often detected only after symptoms become severe. This system aims to help users recognize possible risk earlier so they can seek professional medical evaluation sooner.

 This system is intended for early awareness only and does **not** replace professional medical diagnosis.

## Problem
Kidney stones affect millions of people worldwide and are frequently diagnosed late, leading to severe pain, emergency treatment, and medical complications.

Early awareness can help individuals take timely action and reduce health risks.

---

## Solution
A simple AI-powered web application where users upload kidney images and receive **non-diagnostic, early risk feedback** through an easy-to-use interface.

The solution prioritizes:
- Accessibility  
- User safety  
- Responsible AI usage  
- Clear medical disclaimers  

---

## How It Works (MVP)
The current MVP demonstrates the complete system flow:

1. The user uploads a kidney image  
2. The image is preprocessed (resized and normalized)  
3. AI-based decision logic simulates image analysis  
4. A risk awareness message is displayed on the web interface  

This MVP validates the concept, user flow, and technical architecture.

## Technology Used
- Python  
- Flask (web framework)  
- Basic image preprocessing  
- HTML templates  

---

## AI Usage in the MVP
Artificial Intelligence concepts are used in this MVP to simulate medical image analysis and decision-making logic.

In addition, **AI-assisted development tools** were responsibly used during development to:
- Support learning and research  
- Assist with debugging and optimization  
- Enable rapid prototyping  
- Improve documentation clarity  

All system design decisions, ethical boundaries, and implementation logic were defined and controlled by the author.

## Microsoft AI Services Usage (Production Architecture)
The current MVP runs locally to demonstrate system logic.

In a full production deployment, the solution is designed to be built on **Microsoft Azure AI services**, including:

- **Azure Machine Learning** – for training, validating, and deploying medical image analysis models.
- **Azure AI Foundry / Azure OpenAI** – for explainable AI feedback, user guidance, and responsible AI interaction.

These services ensure scalability, security, and alignment with Microsoft’s Responsible AI principles.

## Ethical Considerations
- This system does **not** provide medical diagnosis  
- Used strictly for early awareness  
- Clear disclaimers are shown to prevent misuse  
- Human medical professionals remain responsible for diagnosis  

---

## Future Improvements
- Train a real AI model using verified medical datasets  
- Deploy models using Azure Machine Learning  
- Integrate Azure Custom Vision  
- Add confidence scoring and explainability  
- Introduce a clinician review dashboard
