AI-Powered Early Kidney Stone Detection (MVP)

Overview
This project is a web-based MVP that provides early awareness of potential kidney stone risk
by analyzing uploaded kidney images.

This system is intended for early awareness only and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

Problem
Kidney stones are often detected late, causing severe pain and medical complications.
Early awareness can help people seek medical attention sooner.

Solution
A simple AI-powered web application where users upload kidney images and receive early
risk feedback.

How It Works (MVP)
1. User uploads a kidney image
2. Image is preprocessed (resized and normalized)
3. AI-based decision logic simulates analysis
4. Result is displayed on the web page

Technology Used
- Python
- Flask
- Image Processing
- HTML
- Future: Azure Custom Vision

Future Improvements
- Train a real AI model using medical datasets
- Integrate Azure Custom Vision
- Improve accuracy with deep learning
- Add confidence score
- Doctor review dashboard

Ethical Considerations
- This is not a medical diagnosis
- Used only for early awareness
- Clear disclaimer shown to users

## Development Note
AI-assisted tools were used during development to support learning, debugging, and rapid prototyping.  
The project design, system integration, and implementation decisions were made by me.
